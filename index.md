## Welcome

Welcome to the CloudShell developer guide!
These pages will take you through all you need to know to become an expert Shell or orchestration developer.
 The guide is intended both for developers taking their first steps with the platform as well as for seasoned CloudShell developers.

### A Shell in NutShell

Shells enable CloudShell users to interact with a wide range of components including physical devices, virtual appliances and apps.

From a developer's perspective, a 'Shell' is a plugin which can used to extend CloudShell. Installing a shell into CloudShell opens up new options for users and administrators. Just to name a few examples:

* New physical components types can be instantiated in CloudShell's inventory.
* New commands can be added to sandbox components
* New apps types can be added to blueprints and deployed in sandboxes

### Orchestration Scripts

Orchestration scripts are the workflows behind the scenes which facilitate sandbox provisioning and cleanup as well as
custom workflows which can be added to the blueprint. CloudShell contains some out of the box scripts but its easy to both extend
their behavior and add new custom workflows to implement new use cases.
